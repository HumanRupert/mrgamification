                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>Tired of time-consuming, unengaging dating apps, we decided to design and develop a gamified
                            dating experience. It's been four months since the start of the app's development and
                            design; during this time, we've attracted many local and international investors and
                            achieved two out of four milestones of the project.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-12 col-md-4 mt-5">
                        <h3>The Problem</h3>
                        <p>Many text-based dating apps can’t make an engaging and fun experience for users. Tedious list
                            of questions, lengthened user biographies, and lack of gamified elements have harmed dating
                            apps’ user experience.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-12 col-md-8 mt-5">
                        <h3>The Method</h3>
                        <p>First of all, our design team conducted comprehensive user research to find about the
                            demographics of dating app users. We also wanted to know about the lackings of current
                            dating apps and how we can improve their user experience.
                            We noticed two main reasons for disengagement of dating app users: unrewarding experiences
                            and long texts. We need to design a new experience for people who has a narrow attention
                            span and want to experience an engaging experience.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-12 mt-5">
                        <h3>The App</h3>
                        <p>Most dating apps use unpredictability mechanics as their primary gamified element. However,
                            we used a few more Core Drives to gamify our platform. By using progress bars, experience
                            points, levels, and achievements, we combined the sense of unpredictability with progress.
                            We wanted to make sure that our platform contains both random and fixed rewards. Players can
                            exchange points for Hearts, which allows them to get more results per session.
                            We, then, used the Appointment Dynamics technique: every day at 11 pm, a live dating session
                            starts, longing no more than 5 minutes. After the session, our algorithm, based on users'
                            responses, matches the like-minded. In the beginning, every user gets no more than one match
                            per session, but by spending points and earning Hearts, they get more and more results per
                            session.
                            <br>
                            To increase user loyalty, we implemented a gamification technique, developed by Yu-Kai Chou,
                            called Alfred Effect. As the users participate in more live sessions and finish levels, our
                            algorithm gathers more data about their interests, and it becomes easier to find matches for
                            them. When we collect enough data about a user, we will show her new peers, regardless of
                            her activity. Of course, she can find more matches by participating in live sessions and
                            finish more levels, but getting a constant amount of matches every ten days, based on her
                            past activities, makes it much harder for the user to remove the app from her phone or mind.

                            social platform for Kharazmi Broker. This social program has had a strong positive impact on
                            all key metrics of Kharazmi Broker, increasing its investments, engagement, and users
                            dramatically.

                        <h3>The Problem</h3>
                        <p>Many people are hesitant to enter the stock market simply because they don’t know its basics
                            and rules; a set of “tedious” theories behind stock market used to make this obstacle even
                            bigger. Kharazmi Broker lacked an engaging method to teach the newcomers the basic ideas
                            behind the stock market so they can make smart investments, too. They also wanted to
                            increase the engagement of stock market experts, i.e., those who have years of experience in
                            the stock market and/or make significant investments.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Method</h3>
                        <p>Mr. Gamification design team, based on the client's needs, divided the users into two
                            categories: Newbies and Masters. We knew that we should find a way to encourage the Masters
                            to mentor the Newbies; in this way, we would be able to increase the Masters' engagement and
                            the Newbies' knowledge at the same time.
                            <br>
                            Then, we decided which gameful elements we are going to use in the platform, based on our
                            audience and our client’s metrics.

                        </p>

                    <div class="col-12 mt-5">
                        <h3>The Platform</h3>
                        <p>The most crucial goal of our design team was to teach the basics of the stock market
                            engagingly and subtly to the users. Thus, we first designed a quest system. Players earn a
                            constant amount of energies at the start of the month, and by accepting every quest, they
                            lose a certain amount of energies (based on quest’s rewards and difficulty), making players
                            extremely conscious about how they spend their energies. The difficulty of every quest
                            depends not only on the task’s complexity but the number of people competing to finish that
                            quest, making players extremely conscious about how other players spend their energies.
                            So far, players are learning how to spend their resources wisely and how to predict how
                            others will spend their resources--two vital skills for every investor. Furthermore, the
                            quests are also about specific stock market principles such as p/e ratio. In other cases,
                            the players need to directly predict future stock prices, which lets them test their
                            forecast skills without actually investing money. This mechanic creates a safe place to
                            learn vital skills.

                        <p>Mr. Gamification design team first made a comprehensive query about the folklore Iranian
                            games. After the research, we came up with a list of entertaining Iranian folklore games,
                            but we still required to improve them with the modern techniques of ARG design.
                            <br>
                            We used the game technique card deck, designed by Andrzej Marczewski, and our unique method
                            of gameful storytelling to improve the gameplay.

                        <p>We finally came up with a series of entertaining games which resonate with Iranian folklore
                            culture. After every round, the losing team had to drop one of its members; this is a game
                            technique which made engaging conflicts between team members.
                            <br>
                            We wanted to make every round's mission wildly different from the previous one, varying from
                            designing the interior of an old Iranian house to playing traditional Iranian physical
                            games.
